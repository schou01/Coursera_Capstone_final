In this project, the goal is to meet some of these requirements and guide users to choose at least 1 or more neighborhoods for their consideration during their relocation. By rating the neighborhoods based upon the available amenities they have, we can recommend the neighborhood in a city in a ranked order. This is the overall goal of this project."
